# Take Home Assessment — Playwright BDD Framework

A test automation framework for [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com), built with **Playwright** and **TypeScript**, using **BDD** (Behaviour-Driven Development) for test authoring and the **Page Object Model (POM)** as the design pattern for page interactions.

Designed for multi-team scalability — each product team owns its feature files, step definitions, and page objects, isolated within their own subfolder under a shared test-type hierarchy.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) | Cross-browser automation (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) |
| [playwright-bdd](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd) | BDD layer for Playwright using Gherkin syntax |
| [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) | Type-safe test and framework code |
| [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) | Human-readable feature files |

---

## Initial Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- npm v8 or higher

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 3. Configure test credentials (for login tests)

The login tests require an existing account on automationexercise.com. Create one manually at https://automationexercise.com/login, then export the credentials as environment variables:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
export TEST_USER_EMAIL=your@email.com
export TEST_USER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export TEST_USER_NAME="Your Name"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:TEST_USER_EMAIL="your@email.com"
$env:TEST_USER_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
$env:TEST_USER_NAME="Your Name"
```

> Registration tests generate a unique email per run — no credentials needed for those.

---

## Running Tests

### Run all tests (all browsers, headless)

```bash
npm test
```

### Run tests with the browser visible

```bash
npm run test:headed
```

### Run tests for a specific browser

```bash
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit
```

### Run tests by team tag

```bash
# Core team only
npx playwright test --grep @core

# User Journeys team only
npx playwright test --grep @user-journeys

# API tests only
npx playwright test --grep @api
```

### Generate CODEOWNERS

```bash
npm run generate:codeowners
```

### View the HTML report

```bash
npm run report
```

## Scalability Design

The folder hierarchy is deliberately structured in two levels:

```
{features|steps}/
  {test-type}/          ← ui, api, mobile, performance, ...
    {team}/             ← core-team, user-journeys-team, checkout-team, ...
```

**Why this order matters:**

- Adding a **new team** only requires creating a `{team}/` subfolder within each relevant test-type directory — zero impact on existing teams.
- Adding a **new test type** (e.g. `mobile/`, `performance/`) only requires a new top-level folder alongside `ui/` and `api/` — zero impact on existing test types.
- CI workflows follow the same convention: `{team}-{type}-tests.yml`. Each team's pipeline is entirely independent.
- Page objects mirror this under `pages/{team}/` — teams own their component directories and can evolve them independently.

This means the framework can scale from 2 to 20 teams, and from 2 to 10 test types, without any structural refactoring.

## How BDD Works in This Framework

```
features/{type}/{team}/*.feature  →  steps/{type}/{team}/*.steps.ts  →  pages/{team}/*.ts
         (what to test)                     (how to test)                  (interactions)
```

### 1. Feature file

Written in plain Gherkin — readable by engineers, QA, and product owners alike:

```gherkin
@core
Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I login with valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in successfully
```

The `@core` tag links this scenario to the Core Team and allows targeted execution in CI.

### 2. Step definitions

Each Gherkin line maps to a TypeScript function. Fixtures (page objects) are injected automatically:

```typescript
Given('I am on the login page', async ({ loginPage }) => {
  await loginPage.goto();
});
```

### 3. Page Object

Encapsulates all locators and actions for a page — steps stay clean, selectors are centralised:

```typescript
export class LoginPage extends BasePage {
  readonly loginEmailInput = this.page.locator('input[data-qa="login-email"]');

  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.loginEmailInput.fill(email);
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 4. Fixtures

Custom Playwright fixtures in [support/fixtures/index.ts](support/fixtures/index.ts) provide two things via dependency injection:

**Page objects** — instantiated once per test and injected by name:
```typescript
Given('I am on the login page', async ({ loginPage }) => {
  await loginPage.goto();
});
```

**Shared scenario state** — typed mutable objects passed by reference, so any step file can read or write them within the same scenario without `(page as any)` casts:

| Fixture | Type | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `apiResponse` | `{ value: APIResponse \| null }` | Raw response from the last API call |
| `apiResponseBody` | `{ value: Record<string, unknown> }` | Parsed JSON body of the last API call |
| `scenarioUser` | `{ apiCreated, newUser }` | User created by API setup or UI registration |
| `cartState` | `{ products: Array<{name, price}> }` | Products added to cart during a scenario |

Because Playwright passes fixture values by reference, a step in `register-api.steps.ts` that writes to `scenarioUser.apiCreated` is immediately visible to a step in `auth.steps.ts` that reads it — with full type safety.

### 5. Code generation

`playwright-bdd` generates standard Playwright spec files from `.feature` files into `.features-gen/` before each run. This happens automatically via `npm test` — never edit files in `.features-gen/` directly.

---

## Multi-Team Ownership

Each team owns a vertical slice of the test suite:

| Folder | Owner |
|---|---|
| `features/ui/core-team/`, `steps/ui/core-team/`, `pages/core-team/` | Core Team |
| `features/ui/user-journeys-team/`, `steps/ui/user-journeys-team/`, `pages/user-journeys-team/` | User Journeys Team |
| `features/api/user-journeys-team/`, `steps/api/user-journeys-team/` | User Journeys Team |
| `steps/api/core-team/`, `support/` | Core Team |

Teams trigger their own CI workflow on changes to their files. The main `ci.yml` runs the full suite on PRs to `main`/`develop`.

Code ownership is enforced via `.github/CODEOWNERS` — generated from [codeowners.yaml](codeowners.yaml).

---

## CI/CD

See [TEST-STRATEGY.md](TEST-STRATEGY.md) for the full CI/CD architecture.

### Workflow overview

```
Push to main/develop
       │
       ├── Core Team / UI     → chromium + firefox + webkit  (parallel)
       ├── Core Team / API    → chromium only
       ├── User Journeys / UI → chromium + firefox + webkit  (parallel)
       └── User Journeys / API → chromium only

Per-team push (path-filtered)
       │
       ├── core-team-ui-tests.yml      → triggered on core-team UI file changes
       ├── core-team-api-tests.yml     → triggered on core-team API file changes
       ├── user-journeys-team-ui-tests.yml  → triggered on UJ UI file changes
       └── user-journeys-team-api-tests.yml → triggered on UJ API file changes
```

All team workflows delegate to a shared reusable template (`ui-tests-template.yml` / `api-tests-template.yml`), so execution logic lives in one place.

---

## Onboarding a New Team

1. Create `features/ui/{team}/`, `features/api/{team}/`, `steps/ui/{team}/`, `steps/api/{team}/`, `pages/{team}/`
2. Add BDD tag `@{team}` to feature files
3. Copy an existing team workflow: `core-team-ui-tests.yml` → `{team}-ui-tests.yml`, update the tag and path filters
4. Register new page objects in [support/fixtures/index.ts](support/fixtures/index.ts)
5. Add the team job to [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
6. Add the team to [codeowners.yaml](codeowners.yaml) and run `npm run generate:codeowners`
